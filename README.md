# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for multi-class image classification tasks.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Classification-CIFAR10.git

## Models
The notebook includes implementations of the following models:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for image classification.
