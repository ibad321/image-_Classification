Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for multi-class image classification tasks.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image-Classification-CIFAR10.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook Image_Classification_CIFAR10.ipynb and run the cells to train and test the models.

You can also use the trained models for prediction on new images by modifying the notebook.

Models
The notebook includes implementations of the following models:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for image classification.
